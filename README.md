A Discord bot focused on providing strong moderation solutions while maintaining simplicity and reliability.

# Self-Hosting

If you're looking at this repository, I'll assume that you want to self-host this bot. Great, it's an easy process thanks to docker & docker-compose.
More details can be found in [`the self hosting guide`](/documentation/Self-Hosting.md).

# Licensing

You're free to do anything you want with the bot, as long as it's not used for malicious purposes or personal gain (yes, you cannot sell free software; stop trying to make a quick buck and get a job).  
Keep in mind that you have to follow Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

For more information on the specific license details, check out the LICENSE file; you can't miss it.
